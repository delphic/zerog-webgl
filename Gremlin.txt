	* Basic World Translate, Rotate, Scale abilities
	* Scalable Debug shapes (and colour specified!)
		* Wireframes and solids of Cubeboids, Rays, Rectangles, Spheres, Cylinders, Circles
	* Texture Management
		(* Texture Filter Configuration Options)
		* Transparency (need to z order, copying Stranded method for this might be a good idea)
		* Render To Texture
	* Sprites (dependant on transparency)
	* Per pixel lighting system
		* Ambient
		* Directional
		* Point Lights
		* Specular Lighting
		* Spot lights
		* Specular Maps
		* Shadow Maps
	* Height Map Terrian Rendering
* Camera Model - basic setting of rotation
	* Sub Camera Objects - FPS, Third Person, Space Camera etc.
* JSON static model loading
	* In engine JSON model creation
	* JSON Animated Models.
* Level Loading from file - setting lighting, models, etc
	* In engine level creation
* Keyboard and Mouse Input
	* Bindable Keys
* Full screen options
* HTML GUI
* WebGL HUD
	* HUDs as separate files
* Maths library
	* Use existing libraries where possible
* Physics
	* Collision Detection
		* Bounding Spheres
			- Bounding Ellipsoid ( only really needed for games with 'shields')
		* Bounding Boxes
			- Sub levels for locational damage
	* Basic Gravity (both directional and point)
* Scene Management

Preparation Work:
Used WAMP to set up a local server. (Chrome doesn't allow you to make HTTP requests when viewing a file locally)
Set up Mercurial as a version control system.

v0.1
* Inline Shaders
* Inline Game Script
	* Basic Game Loop - add reset timer if large time between updates
	* Temporary Camera Movement System via WASD + mouse look by mouse pos being close to the edges of the canvas
* External Engine Script
	* Basic Render Obj at Position
	* Basic Camera
	* Static Debug Shapes
		Cubes, Spheres and Pyramids
	
v0.2
* Fix input not working for not fullscreen - (need to set width)
* Fix Cursor Issues - override default action (also invisible cursor)
* MultiShader Programs and Multiple Shader Scripts
* Basic Textures
* Game Object Manager
* Convert from Debug Shapes to primitives
[* Add Menu Overlay - Meh this can wait until I have something for it to do]

v0.3
* Texture Filters (Global Setting)
* Per Vertex Lighting Shaders
	* Add Normals to Primitives
	* Add uniforms for ambient and single directional light
	* Add useLighting to objects / fullBright
	* Think about how to do multiple lights

v0.4 
* Point Lights - unskew from camera - need coordinate transform functions for rotation (directional light) and position (point lights & presumably spot lights).
* Spot Lights
* Light Manager
	* Remove Color Shaders and add functionality to current shader
* Per Pixel Lighting Shaders
* Loading Objects from Files

v0.5
* Implement Scaling
* Specular Lighting
* Loading 'levels' from Files

v0.6 
* Separte CSS Width and resolution of canvas
* Game Layer - Menu system, loading system, options (texture filtering, lighting, pixel / vertex, resolution).

v0.7
* Create Texture & Model Management
* Decouple objects and their buffers
* Move asset loading management system into engine / own namespace
GAME CODE * Level loading and manangement system to control spawning of enemies and environment

v0.8+
* Material System - include emmissive
* Orthogonal rendering
* Render to Texture
* Alpha Blending
* Specular Maps
* Normal Maps
* Model Animation

THEN onto sound and  Model Conversion Collada -> JSON
