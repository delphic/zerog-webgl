* 3D Rendering Engine
	* Basic World Translate, Rotate, Scale abilities
	* Scalable Debug shapes (and colour specified!)
		* Wireframes and solids of Cubeboids, Rays, Rectangles, Spheres, Cylinders, Circles
	* Texture Management
		(* Texture Filter Configuration Options)
		* Transparency (need to z order, copying Stranded method for this might be a good idea)
		* Render To Texture
	* Sprites (dependant on transparency)
	* Per pixel lighting system
		* Ambient
		* Directional
		* Point Lights
		* Specular Lighting
		* Phase 2: Spot lights
		* Specular Maps
		* Phase 2: Shadow Maps
	* Height Map Terrian Rendering
* Camera Model - basic setting of rotation
	* Sub Camera Objects - FPS, Third Person, Space Camera etc.
* JSON static model loading
	* Phase 2: In engine JSON model creation
	* Phase 3: JSON Animated Models.
* Level Loading from file - setting lighting, models, etc
	* Phase 2: In engine level creation
* Keyboard and Mouse Input
	* Bindable Keys
* Full screen options
* HTML GUI overlays
	* Need to investigate ability to load JQuery event binds after creating inputs - if we plan to use JQuery, try this with normal JS first.
	* GUIs stored in separate files
* Maths library
	* Use existing libraries where possible, make sure it contains planes and ray maths
* Physics
	* Collision Detection
		* Bounding Spheres
			- Bounding Ellipsoid ( only really needed for games with 'shields' 
		* Bounding Boxes
			- Sub levels for locational damage
	* Basic Gravity (both directional and point)
* Scene Management 
	* Frustrum Culling
* Sound
	* BG Music
	* Triggered Sound Effects
	* Phase 2: Directional sound
* Logging - log errors

* Phase 2: AI framework

Preparation Work:
Used WAMP to set up a local server. (Chrome doesn't allow you to make HTTP requests when viewing a file locally)
Set up Mercurial as a version control system.

v0.1
* Inline Shaders
* Inline Game Script
	* Basic Game Loop - add reset timer if large time between updates
	* Temporary Camera Movement System via WASD + mouse look by mouse pos being close to the edges of the canvas
* External Engine Script
	* Basic Render Obj at Position
	* Basic Camera
	* Static Debug Shapes
		Cubes, Spheres and Pyramids
	
Using LearningWebGL lesson 4 as a basis, stole the moon from Lesson 11 though!

v0.2
* Fix input not working for not fullscreen
	* Also investigate speed up of timing for smaller canvas - think this is due to canvas.width being undefined!
* Basic Loading Objects from Files
* Basic Textures
* External Shader Scripts
* Game Object Manager
